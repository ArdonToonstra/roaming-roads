# Map flyTo on Card Focus - Feature Verification

## Feature Description
When a user clicks (or focuses) on a specific card in the trip steps list, the main map smoothly animates and centers on that card's corresponding location.

## Implementation Location
- **Page**: `/trips/[slug]/steps`
- **Components**:
  - `StepsLayout.tsx` - Main layout component that manages state and card interactions
  - `TripDetailMap.tsx` - Map component that renders the map
  - `MapController.tsx` - NEW: Handles map focus changes using react-leaflet's `useMap` hook

## Recent Updates

### Migrated to Modern react-leaflet v5 Pattern
- **Before**: Used deprecated `whenCreated` prop on MapContainer
- **After**: Created dedicated `MapController` component using `useMap()` hook
- **Benefit**: Compatible with react-leaflet v5, cleaner separation of concerns

## How It Works

### 1. User Clicks on a Card
- Location: `StepsLayout.tsx` line 244
- Each `ItineraryBlock` component has an `onClick` handler
- The click triggers `handleStepClick(index)`

### 2. State Update
- Location: `StepsLayout.tsx` lines 194-201
- `handleStepClick` function:
  1. Updates `activeIndex` state with the clicked card's index
  2. Scrolls the clicked card into view

### 3. Map Animation
- Location: `MapController.tsx` lines 25-52
- The MapController component uses `useMap()` hook to access the map instance
- A `useEffect` hook watches for changes to `activeIndex`
- When `activeIndex` changes:
  1. Finds the corresponding marker coordinates
  2. Calls `map.flyTo([lat, lng], zoom, { duration: 0.8 })`
  3. Smoothly animates the map to the selected location

### 4. Visual Feedback
- Location: `StepsLayout.tsx` line 137-138
- Active card receives:
  - Orange border (`borderColor: '#F57D50'`)
  - Elevated shadow
  - Highlighted appearance

## Additional Features

### Scroll-Driven Focus
- The map also responds to scrolling through cards
- An `IntersectionObserver` (lines 203-226) detects which card is in view
- The map automatically follows as you scroll through the itinerary

### Throttling
- Map animations are throttled to 100ms intervals
- Prevents excessive panning during fast scrolling or rapid clicks
- Location: `MapController.tsx` lines 33-36

### Cursor Indication
- Cards show `cursor-pointer` on hover
- Indicates they are clickable
- Location: `StepsLayout.tsx` line 137

## Testing the Feature

To verify the feature works:

1. Navigate to a trip detail page with multiple itinerary steps
   - Example: `/trips/[any-trip-slug]/steps`

2. Click on any card in the left sidebar

3. Observe:
   - ✅ The clicked card gets highlighted with an orange border
   - ✅ The map on the right smoothly animates (flies) to the corresponding location
   - ✅ The map zooms to level 12 for clear visibility
   - ✅ The animation duration is 0.8 seconds

4. Try scrolling through the cards:
   - ✅ The map follows along automatically
   - ✅ The currently centered card gets highlighted

## Code Quality

- Type-safe implementation with TypeScript
- Proper error handling (try-catch blocks)
- Fallback behavior if flyTo is not available (uses setView)
- Development logging for debugging coordinate issues
- Throttling to optimize performance
- Modern react-leaflet v5 pattern using `useMap()` hook
- Clean separation of concerns with dedicated MapController component

## Technical Details

### MapController Component
The `MapController` is a React component that:
- Must be rendered as a child of `MapContainer` to access the map instance
- Uses the `useMap()` hook from react-leaflet v5
- Doesn't render any DOM elements (returns `null`)
- Handles all map focus logic in response to `activeIndex` changes
- Is properly typed with TypeScript interfaces

This pattern is the recommended approach for controlling maps in react-leaflet v5+.
